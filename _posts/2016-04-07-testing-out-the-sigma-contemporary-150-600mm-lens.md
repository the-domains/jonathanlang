Testing out the Sigma Contemporary 150-600mm lens

Here are a few shots I took recently while testing out the Sigma Contemporary 150-600mm lens. The lens is reasonably sharp (for a lens of this kind). The autofocus seems to be reasonably good. I did find the stabilisation a little lacking, but with a mono-pod and enough light it isn't too bad. It's not a lens that would see much use hand-held once the sun starts to go down.
